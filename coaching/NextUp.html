  <!-- Week 1 -->
  <div class="content-card timeline-card faq-item expandable-card">
    <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Week 1: Personality &amp; Preferences</h3>
    <p class="short">Discover your core traits with a scientifically grounded assessment.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We begin with a personality assessment that maps your traits and work style to uncover what energizes you, what drains you, and where you naturally excel. This becomes the foundation for your career direction. Most people find this eye-opening because it highlights patterns, what draws you in and, just as importantly, what you are not interested in.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Week 2 -->
  <div class="content-card timeline-card faq-item expandable-card">
    <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Week 2: Strengths &amp; Gaps</h3>
    <p class="short">Unpack strengths and identify blockers.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We’ll surface the skills you bring to the table and the gaps holding you back, then align them with career opportunities that fit your goals. Our work this week will help you define growth edges, things you want to learn, versus boundaries, things you don’t want to learn and that aren’t part of your career path. I will provide you with a framework to review your work experience through the lens of your skills and preferences, helping you sort through what fit with who you are versus what you had to do to keep your job.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Week 3 -->
  <div class="content-card timeline-card faq-item expandable-card">
    <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Week 3: Rewrite Your Story</h3>
    <p class="short">Reframe your story around impact.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Your career story shifts from tasks to outcomes. Instead of generic bullets, our work focuses on where you bring real value. That will help us craft a story worth telling. Your resume then becomes a true reflection of the work you enjoy and where you’ve proven impact. We’ll start the process together and I will provide you with the framework to continue refining on your own.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Week 4 -->
  <div class="content-card timeline-card faq-item expandable-card">
    <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Week 4: Present You vs. Future You</h3>
    <p class="short">Define your brand and the causes you stand for.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We’ll create your target role statement and ensure every word reflects what you want to do. By leveraging your personality, strengths, boundaries, and growth edges, we’ll help you break old patterns and connect with what lights you up. We will banish jargon to make sure your target role statement is a reflection of you. This work also refines your online presence and sharpens your elevator pitch so it is easy to communicate who you are and what you do.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="short">Learn formats, practice real questions.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>You’ll get hands-on coaching with interview formats, sample questions, and immediate feedback to build confidence. We’ll use proven methods, including STAR case studies, to help you unpack your work history with clarity. You’ll practice showing ownership, collaboration, and impact, not just listing tasks.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Week 6 -->
  <div class="content-card timeline-card faq-item expandable-card">
    <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Week 6: Outreach Strategy</h3>
    <p class="short">Design a natural networking approach.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We’ll build a values-aligned system for outreach that feels authentic, helping you open doors without cold-selling. You’ll start reaching out so people know what you do and what you’re looking for. Your network is larger than you think, and now it’s time to use it. I will provide you with a tracker that will help you not only connect with people, but follow up with intention.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Week 7 -->
  <div class="content-card timeline-card faq-item expandable-card">
    <i class="fa fa-plus faq-icon"></i>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Week 7: Advanced Interviewing</h3>
    <p class="short">Sharpen answers to tough scenarios, negotiate with confidence.</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>From gaps in your story to negotiations, we’ll rehearse the toughest interview challenges until your responses feel natural and strong. Depending on your situation, we might be prepping for crucial conversations at your current job or in a high-stakes interview.</p>

    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>You’ll finish with a roadmap, renewed clarity, and confidence in your next career chapter. Most clients use this stage to turn our work into meaningful conversations. I’ll likely help you prepare for important discussions and plan for the long term while also sharpening your approach for upcoming interviews.</p>

              <p>This program is personalized, strategic, and grounded in action. You’ll receive:
</p>
            
            
              <ul>
                
                  <li><strong>Career Mapping</strong>: Understand where you've been, what drives you, and where you're headed. Get a stronger sense of self including your skills and preferences.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Resume and Story Rewriting</strong>: Present your strengths clearly and with impact, both on paper and in person.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Frameworks for Clarity</strong>: Build stronger elevator pitches and case studies, and learn how to talk about your skills and experience in a way that feels authentic and confident.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>LinkedIn Optimization</strong>: Make the words you use to talk about your skills and experience line up with where you want to go next.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Live Mock Interviews</strong>: Practice with someone who’s hired hundreds and get real-time feedback to sharpen your delivery.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Ongoing Guidance</strong>: Optional support between sessions or during high-stakes moments, such as interviews or outreach.</li>

            <h3>Why This Works</h3>
            
            
              <ul>
                
                  <li><strong>Real Insight:</strong> You’ll get practical advice from someone who’s led hiring, not just observed it.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Tailored Approach:</strong> We’ll adapt based on your goals, pace, and situation. This is not a fixed script.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Clear Language:</strong> I’ll help you talk about your work without jargon or generic phrases.</li>
                
                  <li><strong>Design Thinking Meets Strategy:</strong> My approach blends coaching, facilitation, and executive experience to help you move forward with clarity.</li>
