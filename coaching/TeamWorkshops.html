        <p>CFOs don't know the power and value of design thinking. Sorry CFOs but you know it's (mostly) true! We’ll walk through real challenges and use empathy, ideation, and experimentation to frame better questions, generate deeper insight, and drive strategic innovation.</p>

        <p>Using proven ideation formats, we help teams break out of ruts and generate diverse, high-potential ideas.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                
                  <p>I begin each engagement with a discovery session where we discuss your team’s challenges, goals, and dynamics. Based on that, I design a session with hands-on exercises tailored to your needs. I have a few folks that I can also call upon to help me co-facilitate the sessions for larger groups.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                
                  <p>The ideal size depends on the type of workshop, but typically 5–15 people allows for strong engagement and collaboration.</p>
                
                  <p>Larger teams can benefit from more instructional workshops where we delve into topics to help build a strong culture such as unbiased hiring, building a culture of feedback and collaboration, and structured brainstorming.</p>

                  <p>Virtual workshops are designed to be just as interactive as in-person ones, with breakout sessions, moderated chats, and structured time for both collaborative work and self-reflection. I have conducted several workshops using online platforms such as Meet, Zoom, Teams etc. I'm based in Toronto and happy to travel for in-person sessions if preferred.</p>

                  <p>Yes! These workshops are built for all team dynamics, including quieter or more formal groups. Here's how I make sure everyone feels comfortable and engaged:</p>
                
                  <p><ul> <li><strong>Options for participation</strong> – Not everyone loves speaking up in a big group. I use small breakouts, written reflections, and structured discussions so people can contribute in ways that feel natural.</li> <li><strong>No forced interaction</strong> – Activities are designed to be inclusive but not overwhelming. Team members can ease in at their own pace. I always follow up after sessions for folks who like time to reflect before contributing.</li> <li><strong>A thoughtful approach</strong> – I create a supportive, low-pressure environment where even the most reserved team members feel heard.</li> <li><strong>Engagement beyond talking</strong> – Collaboration doesn’t always mean speaking up. Many exercises involve writing, sketching, or structured brainstorming so ideas flow in different ways.</li> </ul> <p>Your team’s personality shapes the workshop, not the other way around. The goal is to create meaningful engagement in a way that works best for <strong>you.</strong></p></p>
