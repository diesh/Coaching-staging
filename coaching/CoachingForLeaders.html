        <p>We begin with a deep dive into your leadership style using diagnostics and a skills/preferences matrix.

            <p>I work with executives, managers, and high-potential leaders in design, product, and tech.
Whether you’re stepping into leadership or refining your approach, coaching is tailored to your challenges.
I also help leadership teams formulate and communicate strategy so they’re ready for what’s next. Check out <a href="TeamWorkshops.html">team workshops</a> for more on how I help teams think creatively, collaborate effectively, and solve problems with confidence.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Coaching helps you uncover your own answers through strategic questioning and reflection. Mentorship is more advice-based, sharing personal experiences. Coaching empowers you to shape your own leadership style and strategies.
I’m here to hold up a mirror, helping you reflect on where you’ve been, where you’re going, and what’s possible. You’ll gain fresh perspectives, move forward with greater clarity, and take meaningful steps toward your goals.</p>

            <p>The results can be life-changing if you’re ready to put in the work. When you’re willing to step outside your comfort zone and challenge your blind spots, you’ll develop sharper decision-making skills, stronger communication, and a clearer leadership vision.
You’ll gain strategies to navigate conflict, drive alignment, and create lasting impact in your organization. Think of me as your co-pilot, helping you tackle tough situations and equipping you with tools to handle challenges you haven’t faced before.</p>
