    <h2 id="content">Your Partner in Growth</h2>
    <p>Career growth isn’t a one-time event, it’s a journey. With ongoing coaching, you’ll have a trusted partner to help you navigate challenges, stay accountable, and achieve your goals.</p>

        <h2 id="elements">What You’ll Gain</h2>
        <p>Ongoing coaching is tailored to your unique needs, helping you overcome obstacles and achieve sustained success. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
        <ul class="coaching-highlights">
          <li><strong>Break Through Challenges</strong><br />Work through difficult problems with an expert who helps you see blind spots, explore new perspectives, and find solutions to get unstuck.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay Accountable</strong><br />Avoid falling into familiar traps by having someone hold you accountable to your goals, commitments, and progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Combat Loneliness</strong><br />70% of professionals feel lonely at work. With ongoing coaching, you’ll have a trusted ally to rely on, who understands what you’re going through and helps you navigate it with confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Track Progress and Improve Performance</strong><br />Like a gym coach for your career, we’ll create a system to track your progress, celebrate wins, and identify areas for improvement, so you can keep growing and performing at your best.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Personal growth and learning to work well with others is a continuous process of growth, adaptation, and refinement. Successful people don't react to challenges, they proactively shape their path, deepen their self-awareness, and refine their impact. Coaching can provide you the structure, insight, and accountability to help you navigate complex decisions, lead with confidence, and stay ahead in an ever-changing landscape.

                  <p>We meet regularly, biweekly or monthly, to tackle real-time issues, refine your leadership style, and build strategies for long-term success. Sessions are designed to adapt as your needs evolve.</p>

                  <p><strong>No</strong> (Not that there is anything wrong with it 😉)! My coaching is designed to help you focus on your career, your work, and how you show up for your team.</p>
                
                  <p>We’ll tackle leadership challenges, decision-making, and strategies to drive impact. While personal growth is a natural byproduct, this coaching is about professional development, not general life advice.</p>

                  <p>A one-time session is great for addressing a specific challenge or decision, while ongoing coaching is designed for sustained growth.</p>
                
                  <p>It allows us to track progress, refine strategies, and develop deeper leadership capabilities over time. I see ongoing coaching as a two-track approach to your career: acting as your co-pilot for immediate workplace challenges while also providing a long-term perspective on your career trajectory and how you navigate change.</p>

                  <p>That depends on your goals. Most of my clients come to me because they want to 'fix something,' whether it’s navigating a difficult work relationship, overcoming career stagnation, or stepping into new leadership challenges.</p>
                
                  <p>Our first few sessions will map out your journey, clarifying where you’ve been, where you are now, and where you want to go.</p>
                
                  <p>Many clients experience significant transformation within 3-6 months, but growth is an ongoing process. Some choose to continue coaching for a year or more as they take on new challenges and responsibilities.</p>

                  <p>Coaching keeps you accountable and intentional in your career journey. You have to put in the work, but I’m here to support you every step of the way.

                  <p>Longer answer? Growth takes work. I’ll give you “homework” to reflect on your journey, documenting what’s worked, what hasn’t, and where you want to go. This helps us map a better path forward.</p>
                
                  <p>Beyond reflection, we’ll experiment with strategies to strengthen your relationships with your boss and coworkers. This could include communication frameworks, reporting cadences, and techniques to help you become a more effective leader at work.</p>
